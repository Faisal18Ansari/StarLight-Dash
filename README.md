# StarLight-Dash
StarLight Dash is a fast-paced 3D platformer built in Unity. Dodge traps, battle zombies, collect coins, and activate checkpoints. Features NavMesh AI, save/load systems with PlayerPrefs, and responsive controls—all crafted to sharpen my gameplay design skills.

# ⭐ StarLight Dash

**StarLight Dash** is a vibrant 3D platformer built in Unity where you control a quick and nimble character through visually rich environments filled with enemies, collectible coins, tricky obstacles, and interactive power-ups.

This project was developed as part of the **GameInk Internship Test**, and it demonstrates my skills in:
- Character movement and physics (walking, sprinting, jumping, dashing, ground pounding)
- Cinemachine-based camera system
- Game state saving and loading (player position, health, coin count, defeated enemies)
- UI systems for health, coin collection, pause and win screens
- Audio implementation for player actions, environment, and enemies
- VFX for dash, ground pound, and celebration moments
- Scene transitions between main menu and gameplay
- Persistent game logic using PlayerPrefs
